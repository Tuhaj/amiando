    # Get the latest 'synchronization' events. Let's not forget that in this
    # case an 'event' is something that happened. It could be, for instance,
    # that a new ticket was bought, that an event was modified, or similar.
    #
    # Read the http://developers.amiando.com/index.php/REST_API_DataSync docs
    # to find out how it really works. Simplifying, you find by the latest id
    # you have, and go through the events returned.
    #
    # When you find a data synchronization you get everything that happened
    # (events) and the next id you should query for. Next time you should use
    # that id when calling this method.

    # @param last_id

    # @return [Amiando::Sync] with all the [Amiando::Sync::Event]

    # A synchronization event aka 'Something that happened'.
    #
    # You should use mainly 4 attributes:
    #
    # * object_type and returned_object_type will allow you to know what kind
    #   of object you should be dealing with. Read through the official docs
    #   to know the difference between them.
    # * object_id is the id of whichever object you're dealing with.
    # * operation is what happened to that object. Typically 'create', 'delete'
    #   and 'update'. But beware the 'resync' one.
